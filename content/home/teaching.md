During fall 2018 teaching the following courses at Carleton:

- Math 215: Introduction to statistics
- Math 315: Bayesian statistics

Past courses that I have taught at Carleton:

- Math 245: Applied regression
- Math 265: Probability
- Math 275: Introduction to statistical inference

This is an example of using the *custom* widget to create your own homepage section.

To remove this section, either delete `content/home/teaching.md` or edit the frontmatter of the file to deactivate the widget by setting `active = false`.
